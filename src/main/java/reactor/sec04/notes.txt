Flux.create -> flux sink these are designed to be used when we have single subscriber approach.
flux sink is thread safe
we can emit data into sink w/o worrying about downstream demand
it will deliver everything to subscriber safely

 Flux generate
    - invokes the given lambda expression again and again based on downstream demand.
    - We can emit only one value at a time
    - will stop when complete method is invoked
    - will stop when error method is invoked
    - will stop downstream cancels
